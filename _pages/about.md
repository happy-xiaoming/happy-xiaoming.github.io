**How do you know what's the right direction?
I like the answer from Steve Jobs: It comes down to taste. Trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done and then try to bring those things in to what you're doing.**
I am a -0.5 year PhD student(to be updated). My research interest includes robot learning, world model, reinforcement learning and so on.

Details will be added soon!
